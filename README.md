### 💡 About Me
I’m a Data Analyst who turns messy data into clear insights. Using SQL, Python, Power BI, and ML fundamentals, I build systems that help teams forecast demand, detect risk early, and operate more efficiently.  
My experience across **IBM, BCG, Lloyds, Quantium, and Tata** taught me one principle: powerful analytics comes from simplicity, structure, and execution.

I’m most interested in the intersection of **clean energy, automation, and AI**—where data has the power to make real-world impact.
