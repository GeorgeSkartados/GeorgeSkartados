### 💡 About Me
I’m George — a data analyst who **translates complexity into clarity**.  
Using **Python, SQL, and Power BI**, I turn messy datasets into systems that tell a story — helping organizations forecast smarter, detect risk earlier, and operate more efficiently.

My experience through **IBM, Quantium, BCG, Lloyds, and Tata** taught me that great analytics isn’t about more data — it’s about sharper focus. Whether it’s optimizing renewable-energy output or uncovering inefficiencies in business processes, I build tools that move ideas from concept to execution.

I’m most excited about the intersection of **AI, clean energy, and automation** — where intelligent data systems can make our world cleaner, faster, and more secure.
